# ![alt text](https://github.com/JKal24/RS3Merch/blob/master/Site/src/assets/rs3exch_logo_small.png) RS3Exch - A Flipping/Merchanting Tool for Runescape 3

# Introduction

This project was made in a similar vain as ge-tracker where the main purpose is to feed the user with information about various items. 
Information included in the app will be:
* Item information
* Valuation 
* Variation
* Weekly highs and lows

This app will also allow you to add a set of items as favorites to your database.

Information will be organized through the following categories:
* Rising prices
* Falling prices
* Buy Limit filtered
* Type filtered

Disclaimer: This app is not nearly as powerful as ge-tracker due to the simple fact that data accessibility is severely limited in Runescape 3.
OSRS has a custom client which can track player data but this is not the case for Runescape 3.

# Technologies Used

* Frontend: ReactJS, Redux, Axios, React-Router, React-Redux toolkit and React-Bootstrap
* Backend: NodeJS, Express, Cheerio, Axios, dotenv, Node-postgres, cors
